"""
CNDA Python Package

This is a placeholder __init__.py to make the python/cnda directory
discoverable by setuptools. The actual compiled extension module is
built as a top-level 'cnda' module (cnda.so / cnda.pyd).

When you import cnda in Python, you're importing the compiled C++ extension,
not this package.
